—Winds brisk, skies clear. [[Lord Meitremar]] paid passage for himself, his entourage (including a quiet but unnerving sinspawn), and a large wooden case he declared as containing an “exotic pet” for a colleague stationed at an outpost on Thoska Isle.  
  
—Winds brisk, overcast skies. [[Lord Meitremar]] approached me with an adjustment and promised a bonus upon return to Xin-Edasseril. We are no longer bound for Thoska, but the south coast of Chakikoth, to the squatter village of [[Iron Harbor]].  
  
—Winds brisk, rain. [[Lord Meitremar]]’s entourage has been disrupting morale. Elitist attitudes, disrespect for the ship and crew. Looking forward to being rid of him.  
  
—Winds calm, overcast skies. Put crew to work on oars, but made good progress.  
  
—Winds brisk, rain.  
  
—Winds brisk, rain. Deckhand Telsen reported seeing [[Lord Meitremar]]’s sinspawn minion opening and closing a slat on the crate in the hold an hour before sunrise. Suspecting smuggling, I entered the hold to investigate. Movable slat in side of crate could be used to stash goods, but upon opening it I spied within a strange beast, some sort of lanky, six-legged wolf with a plantlike stalk growing from its body. The beast was sleeping, and there were no signs within the crate of smuggled goods. Disciplined Telsen for rumormongering.  
  
—Winds brisk, rain. Arrived at sunset. Still strange to see the old spires in such a rusted state. [[Lord Meitremar]] met with [[Iron Harbor]]’s commander, then left with his entourage to the large stone structure at the edge of the village. Commanded the crew to remain on board and not to mix with local rabble.  
  
—Another day at harbor. A few hours before dawn, several of [[Lord Meitremar]]’s people returned without him and loaded the “exotic pet” crate onto a cart and hauled it off around the peninsula toward Thunderhead Isle. Final straw. This mystery needs to end, and we need to head home. Tomorrow morning I shall debark and pay a visit to [[Stonehome]] and demand a swift leave.
