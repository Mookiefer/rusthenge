Guard and priestess to Gorum at [[Stonehome]] in [[Iron Harbor]].

Took [[Elder Ordwi]] into [[Stonehome]] when we arrived in [[Iron Harbor]].

We encountered her with a couple of [[Fallen Acolytes]] on the second floor of [[Stonehome]]. After we defeated her, she surrendered and said she was forced to aid the "Rust" worshippers or die. She was released and headed to a city to look for aid.
