(Deceased)

Name is Blanton, found out from [[Sister Vanda]].

Found after storm dying at edge of [[Osprey Cove]] by Elder Johedia.
Dressed in rusted armor and clutched an equally rusted religious symbol of Gorum in one hand. Suffering from exposure, two infected crossbow bolt wounds, and a strange sickness that left rust-red splotches all over his body. ([[The Rust Creep]])
Dying words, “[[Iron Harbor]]… rust… ship… all dead… before… too late… ”

A Dero named Sydri was trying to kill him along the path between [[Iron Harbor]] and [[Osprey Cove]].
