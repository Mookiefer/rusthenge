(Deceased)
Name is Blanton ([[Sister Vanda]] told us).

Dressed in rusted armor and clutched an equally rusted religious symbol of Gorum in one hand. Suffering from exposure, two infected crossbow bolt wounds, and a strange sickness that left rust-red splotches all over his body. ([[The Rust Creep]])
Dying words, “[[Iron Harbor]]… rust… ship… all dead… before… too late… ”

A Dero named Sydri was trying to kill him along the path between [[Iron Harbor]] and [[Osprey Cove]]. We defeated her along with her two Giant Centipedes.
