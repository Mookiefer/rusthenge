The party's home village.
Founded by siblings [[Dartanious]] and [[Santwi]].

Osprey Cove is a quaint and isolated fishing village nestled along the rugged coastline, where the sound of waves crashing against the shore is ever-present. With a population of about 120, the village is predominantly human, though a small number of other ancestries add to the diversity of its residents. The people of Osprey Cove speak Common and Varisian, and their lives are deeply intertwined with the sea and the rhythms of nature.

The village operates under the guidance of a council of elders, but governance is largely communal. Every villager plays a part in maintaining the well-being of their home, and cooperation is a way of life. The sense of community is strong, with neighbors always ready to lend a helping hand, making Osprey Cove a place where unity and mutual support are highly valued.

Most villagers are devout followers of Desna and Cayden Cailean, drawing inspiration from the freedom and joy these deities represent. However, life in Osprey Cove is not without its challenges. The village often finds itself at odds with the nearby settlement of [[Iron Harbor]], and the resurgence of [[New Thassilon]] poses new and unpredictable threats. Additionally, the seasonal storms that batter the coast can be both a blessing and a curse, providing bountiful catches but also risking lives and livelihoods.

Despite these dangers, the spirit of Osprey Cove remains indomitable. It's a place where the beauty of nature and the strength of community come together, creating a harmonious and resilient village by the sea.
