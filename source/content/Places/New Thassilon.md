A young nation located in northwestern Avistan, founded by the two surviving runelords of ancient Thassilon, Sorshen and Belimarius. It consists of two co-existing kingdoms: 

##### EURYTHNIA 
The world-open kingdom of Eurythnia ruled by Queen Shorshen as a liberal place of art where exiles can start a new life fashioned after the image of the succubus-turned-goddess Nocticula. 

##### EDASSERIL 
The more aggressive and harsher ruled Edasseril is overseen by Queen Belimarius, who looks upon neighboring nations with jealousy, which is the more aggressive and stricter ruled of the two and quickly found itself in conflict with the Mierani forest and the Ironbound Islands.
