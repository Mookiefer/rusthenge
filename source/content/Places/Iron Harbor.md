Sister village to [[Osprey Cove]], a day's ride to the east.

Iron Harbor is a remote and rugged village, known to be inhabited by fierce and hardy folk. Nestled away from prying eyes, its population is small, with a majority being humans. The village operates under the strict leadership of a high priest of Gorum, whose authority is rooted in religious devotion.

The way of life is shaped by their worship of Gorum, the god of battle and iron. This martial influence is evident in the way the villagers live and work, with a focus on strength and self-sufficiency.

Rumors speak of the villagers' proficiency in crafting and acquiring weapons and armor, making Iron Harbor a place where one can find well-made tools of war. However, like many coastal settlements, it is not immune to the wrath of seasonal storms that test the resilience of its inhabitants. Despite its isolation and the harsh conditions, Iron Harbor stands resolute, a testament to the enduring spirit of its people.
