Temple to Gorum in [[Iron Harbor]] headed by [[Lord Ragnulf]].

Upon us entering the keep we saw it seemingly deserted with many corpses due to [[The Rust Creep]]. There was a starved goat in a nearby pen. 

The inner keep was being guarded by some [[Fallen Acolytes]]. 

The basement had a couple of cat-like creatures that turned out to be demons called Esipils. There was a locked room that contained a number of [[Stonehome]]'s acolytes that have been infected with [[The Rust Creep]]. We left them for the time being until we have secured the keep. A natural tunnel led off from the basement into darkness.

On the second floor we encountered [[Sister Vanda]] along with two Fallen Acolytes.
